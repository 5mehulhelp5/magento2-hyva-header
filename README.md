# Hyv√§ Themes - Header

Completely restructures the default hyva header making it more flexible to adapt to individual needs using layouts instead of one large phtml ("header.phtml").

In addition it is really easy to add a sticky header feature by adding a simple layout update. This only works properly in combination with the hyva drawers (https://github.com/OvalMedia/magento2-hyva-drawers).
